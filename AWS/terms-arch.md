| AWS Concept                         | Azure Equivalent                    | Description                                                                           |

| **Root Organization**               | **Root Management Group**           | The top-level container in Azure. All resources and management groups exist under it. |
| **Organizational Unit (OU)**        | **Management Group (MG)**           | Logical containers that help organize subscriptions for policy, RBAC, and compliance. |
| **AWS Account**                     | **Azure Subscription**              | The billing and isolation boundary for Azure resources.                               |
| **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** | **Azure Policy / RBAC Assignments** | Used to enforce compliance and security standards.                                    |

## üß© AWS Identity & Access Concepts ‚Äî and How They Relate in the Organization Hierarchy

| **Concept** | **What It Is** | **Where It Applies in the Hierarchy** | **Real-World Analogy** | **Relation to Others** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| üè¢ **Service Control Policy (SCP)** | Organization-level *guardrails* that restrict what actions accounts can take ‚Äî even if IAM allows them. | **Root** and **Account** levels in **AWS Organizations** (not OU yet in FortiCNAPP). | **Company-wide HR policy**: ‚ÄúNo one can access payroll.‚Äù | SCPs are *outer boundaries* ‚Äî they override IAM permissions. |
| üóÇÔ∏è **Organizational Unit (OU)** | A logical grouping of AWS accounts under a parent organization root. SCPs can be attached here too. | **Mid-level** between Root and Account. | **Department** (e.g., ‚ÄúFinance,‚Äù ‚ÄúEngineering‚Äù). | OUs inherit SCPs from their parent (Root). |
| üß± **Account** | An isolated AWS environment where users, roles, and resources live. | **Lowest level** in the Org hierarchy. | **Subsidiary or branch office.** | Each account enforces SCPs + IAM policies together. |
| üë• **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** | The AWS service that manages *who can do what* inside a single account. | **Inside an Account** | **Company HR system** | IAM enforces identity-level permissions under the SCP limits. |
| üßë‚Äçüíº **IAM Role** | A temporary identity used by AWS services, users, or external systems to act in your account. | **Inside an Account** | **Job title** ‚Äî e.g., ‚ÄúBackupManager‚Äù | Roles are governed by IAM policies and Trust policies. |
| üìú **IAM Policy** | JSON-based permission document defining *what actions* are allowed or denied. | **Attached to IAM Roles, Users, or Groups** | **Job description** ‚Äî defines allowed tasks. | Policies give specific permissions within the account. |
| üîí **Trust Policy (AssumeRole)** | Defines *who* can assume a role (e.g., from another account or service). | **Attached to IAM Roles** | **Badge access rule** ‚Äî ‚ÄúOnly people from Dept A can wear this badge.‚Äù | Controls **which principals** can use an IAM role. |
| üì¶ **Resource Policy** | A policy *on a resource* (like an S3 bucket or KMS key) defining who can access it. | **At the resource level** inside an account. | **Guest list** on the resource itself. | Adds another layer of permissions *directly* on resources. |

| **Component** | **Description** | **FortiCNAPP Usage / Notes** |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| üì® **SNS Topic** | An **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** topic is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel, grouping multiple endpoints such as AWS, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, or email addresses. | Required for **all CloudTrail integrations**.<br>FortiCNAPP can use an **existing SNS topic** or create one automatically if not present. |
| üì¨ **SQS Queue** | **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** enables distributed applications to exchange messages asynchronously. SNS and SQS together deliver notifications immediately while persisting messages for later processing. | Required for **all CloudTrail integrations**.<br>Used alongside SNS to deliver CloudTrail events to FortiCNAPP. |
| üóÉÔ∏è **S3 Bucket** | An **Amazon S3 bucket** is a container for objects. CloudTrail stores log files in S3 buckets. | Required for **all CloudTrail integrations**.<br>FortiCNAPP can use an existing S3 bucket or create one in the designated AWS account. |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **CloudTrail** | **AWS CloudTrail** records user, role, or service actions across your AWS account for governance, compliance, and audit purposes. | Required to capture and deliver event logs to FortiCNAPP.<br>FortiCNAPP can use an **existing CloudTrail** or create a new one. |
| üîê **IAM Cross-Account Role** | An **IAM cross-account role** grants FortiCNAPP access to AWS resources for configuration assessment and CloudTrail event analysis. | Required for **read-only access**.<br>Includes two policies:<br>‚Ä¢ **FortiCNAPP custom audit policy** ‚Äì read-only access to configuration resources.<br>‚Ä¢ **FortiCNAPP custom IAM policy** ‚Äì read-only access to ingest CloudTrail logs. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note** | Ensure your **IAM cross-account role** and **S3 bucket** are created in the **same AWS account** ‚Äî regardless of setup method (manual, CloudFormation, or Terraform). | This is due to **legacy AWS access control rules**. Cross-account access alone is **not sufficient** to bypass these S3 restrictions. |
