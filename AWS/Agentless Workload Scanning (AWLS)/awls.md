# ☁️ AWS: Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)


## 🧠 Why Agentless Workload Scanning ?

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Overview** | **Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)** provides comprehensive visibility into **vulnerability risks** and **secrets** across your cloud workloads — without installing agents. |
| **Flexibility & Coverage** | Offers broad scanning capabilities for both **hosts** and **container images**, including:<br>• Scanning **running containers**<br>• Scanning **images stored on disk** |
| **Key Benefits** | • Gain insight into **CVEs** on hosts and containers.<br>• Eliminate the need to install or manage agents.<br>• Maintain **private-by-design** scanning within your own AWS environment.<br>• Improve coverage for **container and host vulnerability detection**. |
| ⚠️ **Note** | • **AWLS does not provide workload activity monitoring.**<br>• To gain full runtime visibility and behavioral analytics, you must also deploy the **FortiCNAPP Agent**.<br>• Agentless is **complementary** to the agent — designed to **co-exist**, not replace it. |
| 🧾 **Supported Operating Systems (Linux & macOS)** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/671486)<br>Lists supported Linux distributions and macOS versions for FortiCNAPP agent and agentless workload scanning. |
| 🪟 **Agentless Scanning for Windows** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/838971/agentless-scanning-for-windows)<br>Details supported Windows operating systems for agentless workload scanning. |
| 🧠 **Host OS and Language Library Support for Vulnerability Assessment** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/999307/host-os-and-language-library-support-for-vulnerability-assessment#supported-linux-operating-systems-packages-and-language-libraries)<br>Reference list of supported operating systems, packages, and language libraries used in FortiCNAPP vulnerability assessments. |

## Agentless Scanning Overview

| **Feature / Description** | **Details** |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Default Behavior** | Agentless scans the **root volume** of a host for vulnerabilities by default. |
| **Secondary Volumes** | Any volumes mounted by **filesystem UUID** or **label** will also be scanned if scanning of secondary volumes is enabled. |
| **Kubernetes Persistent Volumes** | Agentless **does not yet scan persistent volumes in Kubernetes**, specifically those tagged with `kubernetes.io/created-for/pv/name`. |
| **Scanning Method** | Agentless workload scanning creates **snapshots** of disk volumes and analyzes them **without impacting** the performance of the primary volumes. |
| **Snapshot Process** | Snapshots are requested for each volume on each instance. A **job queue**

# 🚀 How Agentless Workload Scanning Is Deployed ?
## 🔧 AWS Cloud Account Configuration Workflow (FortiCNAPP) Using FortiCNAP CLI


| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Overview** | In this setup, **Terraform** is used via the **FortiCNAPP CLI** to deploy a **multi-regional, single-account** or **multi-account** environment. |
| ⚠️ **Pre-Deployment Note** | Make sure you have both:<br>🟦 **AWS Profile** — for your **AWS account integration**<br>🟩 **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) Profile** — for your **FortiCNAPP tenant integration**<br><br>📘 For setup instructions and configuration details, see **[Main AWS Folder `README.md`](../README.md)**. |
| **1-2** | 1. Generate the AWS cloud-account integration using the **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) CLI**:<br>` lacework generate cloud-account aws`<br><br>* 2.(Optional)* Specify a profile if you are using multiple:<br>`lacework generate cloud-account aws --profile default` |
| **3** | During setup, you’ll be prompted for configuration options such as:<br><br>• **Enable integrations for AWS organization** → No<br>• **Main AWS account profile** → default<br>• **Main AWS account region** → eu-central-1<br>• **Enable Agentless integration** → Yes<br>• **Add another scanning AWS account** → Yes<br>• **Scanning AWS account profile** → default<br>• **Scanning AWS account region** → me-south-1<br>• **Enable Configuration integration** → No<br>• **Enable CloudTrail integration** → No<br>• **Custom output location** → .<br>• **Run Terraform plan now?** → Yes |
| **4** | Terraform providers installed:<br>• `hashicorp/null`<br>• `hashicorp/aws`<br>• `lacework/lacework`<br>• `hashicorp/random` |
| **5** | Verify the integration:<br>`lacework -p onboarding cloud-account list`<br><br>**Expected output summary:**<br>• **Name:** aws-agentless-scanning<br>• **Type:** AwsSidekick<br>• **Status:** Enabled<br>• **State:** Ok |
| **6** | Delete the deployment (destroy Terraform resources):<br>`terraform destroy` |

## 🧩 What Is Deployed in a Workflow ?

### 🛡️ Private-by-Design: 

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1** | The customer runs the **Agentless AWLS Terraform module** to deploy the required resources in their AWS environment. |
| **2** | Terraform template provisions:<br>• **IAM Roles**<br>• **S3 Bucket**<br>• **ECS Cluster** (with *Sidekick* container)<br>• **VPC**, **Subnet**, and **Internet Gateway** per region |
| **3** | The **Sidekick container** is executed as part of an **ECS Fargate task**. |
| **4** | The task enumerates customer workloads, identifies attached block volumes, securely mounts them, and initiates the scanning process. |
| **5** | Scanning results are written to the customer’s **S3 bucket**. |
| **6** | **FortiCNAPP** reads metadata and scan results from the customer’s **S3 bucket** for further processing. |
| 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup** | The scanner periodically removes **old snapshots** and **stale scan tasks** to maintain efficiency. |
| ⏱️ **Scan Frequency** | By default, scans run **every 24 hours**. |
| 🔒 **Privacy-First Design** | **FortiCNAPP** has **no direct access** to customer workloads — it interacts only with the resources it deploys, using **limited IAM permissions**. |
| 🎯 **Selective Scanning** | You can limit the scanned hosts using an explicit **query filter**. By default, all workloads are scanned. |
| 🐳 **Powered by ECS** | *Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)* is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. |
