# ☁️ AWS: Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)


## 🧠 Why Agentless Workload Scanning ?

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Overview** | **Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)** provides comprehensive visibility into **vulnerability risks** and **secrets** across your cloud workloads — without installing agents. |
| **Flexibility & Coverage** | Offers broad scanning capabilities for both **hosts** and **container images**, including:<br>• Scanning **running containers**<br>• Scanning **images stored on disk** |
| **Key Benefits** | • Gain insight into **CVEs** on hosts and containers.<br>• Eliminate the need to install or manage agents.<br>• Maintain **private-by-design** scanning within your own AWS environment.<br>• Improve coverage for **container and host vulnerability detection**. |
| ⚠️ **Note** | • **AWLS does not provide workload activity monitoring.**<br>• To gain full runtime visibility and behavioral analytics, you must also deploy the **FortiCNAPP Agent**.<br>• Agentless is **complementary** to the agent — designed to **co-exist**, not replace it. |
| 🧾 **Supported Operating Systems (Linux & macOS)** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/671486)<br>Lists supported Linux distributions and macOS versions for FortiCNAPP agent and agentless workload scanning. |
| 🪟 **Agentless Scanning for Windows** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/838971/agentless-scanning-for-windows)<br>Details supported Windows operating systems for agentless workload scanning. |
| 🧠 **Host OS and Language Library Support for Vulnerability Assessment** | [View Documentation →](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/999307/host-os-and-language-library-support-for-vulnerability-assessment#supported-linux-operating-systems-packages-and-language-libraries)<br>Reference list of supported operating systems, packages, and language libraries used in FortiCNAPP vulnerability assessments. |

## 🚀 How AWLS Is Deployed
### 🔧 Configuration Flow (Enabling AWS AWLS Only)
In this setup, **Terraform** is used via the **FortiCNAPP CLI** to deploy a **multi-regional, single-account** or **multi-account** environment.

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> Before you start, make sure you have both:
>
> - 🟦 **AWS Profile** — for your **AWS account integration**
> - 🟩 **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) Profile** — for your **FortiCNAPP tenant integration**
>
> 📘 For setup instructions and configuration details, refer to the  
> **[Main AWS Folder `README.md`](../README.md)** file.


### 🧩 Configure AWS Cloud Account Integration

Run the following command to generate your AWS cloud account integration using the **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) CLI**:

```bash
lacework generate cloud-account aws
```

or explicitly specify the FortiCNAPP CLI profile (optional for default but required for other profile or multi-profile created ):
```bash
lacework generate cloud-account aws --profile default
```

## 🧩 What Is Deployed?

## 🛡️ Private-by-Design: Agentless Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1** | The customer runs the **Agentless AWLS Terraform module** to deploy the required resources in their AWS environment. |
| **2** | Terraform template provisions:<br>• **IAM Roles**<br>• **S3 Bucket**<br>• **ECS Cluster** (with *Sidekick* container)<br>• **VPC**, **Subnet**, and **Internet Gateway** per region |
| **3** | The **Sidekick container** is executed as part of an **ECS Fargate task**. |
| **4** | The task enumerates customer workloads, identifies attached block volumes, securely mounts them, and initiates the scanning process. |
| **5** | Scanning results are written to the customer’s **S3 bucket**. |
| **6** | **FortiCNAPP** reads metadata and scan results from the customer’s **S3 bucket** for further processing. |
| 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup** | The scanner periodically removes **old snapshots** and **stale scan tasks** to maintain efficiency. |
| ⏱️ **Scan Frequency** | By default, scans run **every 24 hours**. |
| 🔒 **Privacy-First Design** | **FortiCNAPP** has **no direct access** to customer workloads — it interacts only with the resources it deploys, using **limited IAM permissions**. |
| 🎯 **Selective Scanning** | You can limit the scanned hosts using an explicit **query filter**. By default, all workloads are scanned. |
| 🐳 **Powered by ECS** | *Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)* is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. |
