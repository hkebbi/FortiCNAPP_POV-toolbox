# ☁️ Azure: Cloud API Integration



Requirements
Azure Global Administrator - An Azure portal account that has a Global Administrator role for your tenant's directory.
Azure Owner Role - An Azure portal account with the Owner role in all subscriptions that you want to monitor.
Lacework Administrator - A Lacework account with administrator privileges.`
Next Steps
As an account with global administrator access and owner privileges to the subscription being used, go to the Azure Cloud Shell.
Paste the command and press enter. This downloads the Lacework CLI, sets up the CLI with your configuration, calls the CLI non-interactively, and applies Terraform. When the command finishes, the new integration appears in the Cloud accounts list after you refresh the Lacework Console screen.
