# ☁️ Azure: Cloud API Integration


### 🧾 Onboarding Requirements (Just for deployment phase - Terraform) 

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Azure Global Administrator** | An Azure portal account that has the **Global Administrator** role for your tenant's directory. |
| **Azure Owner Role** | An Azure portal account with the **Owner** role in all subscriptions that you want to monitor. |
| **Lacework FortiCNAPP Administrator** | A Lacework account with **administrator privileges** to create and manage cloud integrations. |
| ⚡ **Deployment Methods** | Supported installation environments and automation options:<br>• **Azure Cloud Shell**<br>• **Host connected to Azure subscription being used** | — |


## 🧠 Why Cloud API Integration ?

### ☁️ Azure Integration Overview

| Description |
|--------------|
| Integrates with your Azure Cloud API environment to provide visibility into **Configuration Compliance**, **Cloud Identity Risk Management**, and **Threat Detection** across your cloud environment. |
| FortiCNAPP connects to Azure through a secure **service principal and role-based access** to collect **configuration**, **identity**, and **activity** data. |
| The following integrations — **CSPM**, **Activity Log**, and **CIEM** — work together to deliver unified visibility and risk analysis across your Azure environment. |


## ☁️ Azure Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) — Configuration Workflow

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Provides comprehensive visibility into Azure configuration risks, misconfigurations, and compliance posture across subscriptions, tenants, and resources. |
| **Data Source** | **Reader Role (Subscription Level)** – Grants read-only access to view Azure resources and their configurations within a subscription, without the ability to modify them. This allows FortiCNAPP to collect posture and compliance data across supported Azure services such as compute, networking, storage, and security configurations.<br>**Key Vault Reader Role (Subscription Level)** – Allows FortiCNAPP to access metadata of all Key Vaults in the subscription. Any new Key Vaults added will automatically be included for compliance monitoring.<br>**Directory Reader Role (Microsoft Entra ID)** – Enables FortiCNAPP to collect directory objects (users, groups, members, and app registrations) from Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Graph API calls. This identity data supports LQL (Lacework Query Language) datasources and IAM compliance policies. |
| **Workflow** | FortiCNAPP connects using the Azure service principal with the above roles. It reads configuration and identity data from Azure services and evaluates them against built-in security and compliance frameworks (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, ISO, etc.). When Directory Reader is granted, identity-based posture and IAM compliance checks are also performed. |
| **Findings** | Identifies misconfigurations such as open Network Security Groups (NSGs), publicly accessible storage or Key Vaults, disabled encryption, missing diagnostic settings, and non-compliant access policies. |
| **Outcome** | Provides continuous configuration visibility, compliance scoring, and least-privilege posture assessment across all Azure subscriptions and directories. |
| **Notes** | If the **Directory Reader** role is **disabled**, FortiCNAPP will not collect Entra ID (Azure AD) user, group, or app registration data. As a result, related **LQL datasources** and **IAM compliance policies** will not be evaluated—this may be required in environments with strict privacy or regulatory controls. |

## 📜 Azure Activity Log Integration — Configuration Workflow

### 🔁  Azure Activity - Terms Definition notes (General)

| Stage | What It Does | Data Type |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Azure Monitor Diagnostic Settings** | Exports Azure Activity Logs from each subscription to a centralized Storage Account under `insights-activity-logs/` | Activity Log JSON files |
| **Event Grid** | Detects creation of new Activity Log blobs in the Storage Account and triggers notifications when new data is available | Event notification |
| **Storage Queue** | Receives and stores notifications from Event Grid containing the blob path and metadata about newly created log files | JSON message |

-----
### 📜 Azure Activity - Configuration Workflow
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Collects and analyzes Azure subscription activity for anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, and forensic visibility. |
| **Data Source** | **Azure Activity Logs** – Captures control-plane operations.<br>**Custom Role (Resource Group Level)** – Allows FortiCNAPP to read storage, queues, Event Grid, and keys via Azure APIs. |
| **Workflow** | Azure Monitor exports Activity Logs → logs written hourly to a central Storage Account (`insights-activity-logs`) → Event Grid detects new blobs → sends notifications to a Storage Queue → Lacework FortiCNAPP leverages an Event Grid subscription that creates Queue messages → Lacework FortiCNAPP pulls the new logs as soon as they appear. |
| **Findings** | Detects suspicious admin actions, unauthorized changes, and unusual control-plane activity. |
| **Outcome** | Provides near real-time visibility into Azure operations with correlated identity and configuration insights. |

### 🔐 Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) — Configuration Workflow (Azure)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Analyzes Azure users, roles, and assignments to identify excessive permissions, risky access, and privilege escalation paths. |
| **Data Source** | Data from **CSPM** and **Activity Log** integrations mentioned above, no additional integration required |
| **Workflow** | FortiCNAPP leverages data from CSPM and Activity Log integrations to map role assignments, identity relationships, and access activities, building an **identity graph** that correlates permissions with real usage. |
| **Findings** | Detects unused or excessive role assignments, custom roles with high privilege scope, inherited access chains, and potential privilege escalation risks. |
| **Outcome** | Provides complete Azure IAM visibility, access path mapping, and least-privilege recommendations to improve identity security and compliance posture. |
